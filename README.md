# Google Map Application

Current running version:

<a href="https://rich-tribute-135219.appspot.com/" target="_blank">https://rich-tribute-135219.appspot.com/</a>

As far as technology is concerned, this is just an experiment using very basic techniques (some simple python with Google's Fusion Tables API on the server and javascript - jQuery - Google Maps API on the client). In the next version I would like to use more powerful techniques which enable writing clear and testable code.

My vision is that in the long run this will be an interface which helps getting to know the people in your neighborhood or locals living in the area you want to explore. Importing existing advertisements based on a simple JSON configuration per adds-portal is just the first step in this direction.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you would like to join and / or have some ideas, questions or suggestions about it.
